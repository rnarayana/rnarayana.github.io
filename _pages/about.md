Hi! I am Narayana Rengaswamy. I work as a software architect at [Optym](https://optym.com/). I have been working in the software industry for 14 years starting in Operations, as a sql server DBA, software developer and as an architect.

I enjoy programming and software development, particularly writing clean code, designing scalable and maintainable software. I also enjoy working on DevOps, automating stuff, improving security and migrating old systems to newer architectures and cloud.

I love reading books, doing yoga, enjoy listening to classical and Indian music, and in general learning new things.
