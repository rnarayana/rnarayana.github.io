# Welcome

Hi there! This is going to be the first of a series of posts that talk about designing and implementing a multi-tenant distributed system. I'll update the links here to the other posts as and when I publish them.

In my current company, I have been working on a product that is used by multiple B2B customers. This is not your internet scale B2C application, but customized SaaS solutions for enterprises. It takes weeks and months to sign up a new customer, and involves pilots, customization and new development. But the resulting customized application is not a stand alone solution for that customer, but is fed back into our own SaaS product.
